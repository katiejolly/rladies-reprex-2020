## Reproducible examples

Reproducible examples [allow someone else to recreate your problem by just copying and pasting R code](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html)

But they can be tedious to write. The {reprex} package helps with that!

## A reproducible example

``` r
seq(1, 10) # I want this to count by 2
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

<sup>Created on 2020-03-19 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.3.0)</sup>

## Writing reproducible examples

Let's say you want a reproducible example for generating a sequence of numbers that counts by 2, but can only make it count by 1 currently. There are a few ways to do this:

\#1 **Copy** your code to your clipboard and then run `reprex()`

\#2 **Wrap** your code with `reprex()`

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex(seq(1, 10))
```

\#3 **Wrap** an input filepath with `reprex()`

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex(input = "my_reprex.R")
```

\#4 Use the reprex **RStudio Addin**

You'll then have a **reprex** in your clipboard to paste! Since `reprex()` is meant to be run interactively, avoid leaving it in your code. 


---

## \#1: Write Comments liberally 

In order to leave descriptive comments throughout, it's often easier to write multi-line code.

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex({ # <- notice the {} enclosing the code
  # I want to count by 2
  seq(1, 10)
  # But I can only figure out how to count by 1
})
```


``` r
# I want to count by 2
seq(1, 10)
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
# But I can only figure out how to count by 1
```

This also helps readers spot your problem and see your thought process. It can also greatly help you resolve your own question! 
---

## \#2: Use data that others can use

The general advice is to make your data as **boring** as possible. This means try to use data that is readily available like `mtcars` or `iris`. But let's say you have a more specific question. 

```{r include = FALSE}
df <- tibble(person = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), 3), date = c(rep("2020-01-01", 3), rep("2020-02-01", 3), rep("2020-03-01", 3)), total = sample(c("1", "2", "3"), 9, replace = TRUE))
```

You might post this code on StackOverflow and ask: Why are all my averages NA?

```{r warning = FALSE}
df %>%
  group_by(person) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(total))
```

But, no one else can run your code to see where things go wrong :(

---

Without more context, it's really tough to see the problem. With a combination of {datapasta} & {reprex} we can write a much better question! In general we want the smallest dataset possible, so I like to use `head()` to get just a few rows.

```{r}
library(datapasta)

x <- tribble_construct(head(df)) 
 # writes code to reconstruct table
cat(x)
```

---

Then we can post a better question with the data included:

``` r
library(dplyr)
df <- tibble::tribble(
  ~person,        ~date, ~total,
  "A", "2020-01-01",    "3",
  "B", "2020-01-01",    "3",
  "C", "2020-01-01",    "1",
  "A", "2020-02-01",    "1",
  "B", "2020-02-01",    "3",
  "C", "2020-02-01",    "1"
)
df %>%
  group_by(person) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(total)) # I expected this to give 1 for C, for example. But it's NA

#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   person average
#>   <chr>    <dbl>
#> 1 A           NA
#> 2 B           NA
#> 3 C           NA
```

And someone will be able to help you see that your numbers are actually characters, thus giving NA! Much easier than the previous guesswork.

## \#3 Shorter code is better & clean up after yourself

Maybe later on you want to plot your data and change the colors. But we don't need to know that to answer the wrangling question!



```{r messy_example, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)
library(ggthemes)

df %>%
  group_by(person) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(total)) # I expected this to give 1 for C, for example. But it's NA
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

decorate("messy_example") %>% 
  flair("library(colorspace)", background = "pink") %>%
  flair("library(ggthemes)", background = "pink")
```

And if you write a file, delete it after! But do **not** delete anything you didn't write.

```{r eval = FALSE}
...
write_file(df, "output.csv")
file.remove("output.csv")
```

## \#4 `sessionInfo` is a helpful look at your environment

If you have old/out-of-date packages, this is easiest to see with your session information. It's a summary of your R version, packages, and their versions.

There are two ways to include this information:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# argument to reprex()
reprex(..., si = TRUE)

# OR

# manually include the function
reprex({
  ...
  sessionInfo()
})
```


---
## \#5 Test your question in a fresh R session before posting it

Often you'll solve your own problem by writing a **good** question! You may find that you had overwritten an object or another somewhat-invisible error.

To make sure that the code will run on someone else's machine, make sure to test it in a **NEW** R session. Don't just clear your environment! This is not the same thing. 

You can do this by clicking `Session` -> `Restart R`

Or with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl[cmd]+shift+F10`
